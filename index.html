                                in computer science with a concentration in game developement. I love coffee, playing and making video games, all things Disney, and a lot of other things that wouldn't fit 
                                if I listed them all.<br /><br />

                                Previously, I was the Media Director for Women in Computer Science at NC State, a junior officer in the Video Game Development Club, a workshop leader in STARS SLC, a CSC 
                                Ambassador,a Unity student ambassador (beta class), and the lead media and marketing organizer for DiamondHacks. I also worked for the Computer Science Department at

                                I've worked at IBM as a support engineer intern, Juniper Networks as a systems engineer intern, and Bethesda as a programming intern. I make and play games in my free time and I'm constantly

                                    Spilt Milky Way was made in CSC482 as part of a class game jam during the last week of classes. Much of this game was rushed (like many game jam games are) 
                                    and was handed off from teammate to teammate until the last day of class. The game is a 2D space themed game where you control two spaceships, one with the 
                                    left analog stick and one with the right. The goal is to line your ships up to fire at incoming projectiles. It's harder than it sounds to keep them lined up 
                                    without dying!

                                    Jacob Stone and I inherited a Kinect game from Emily Sharp. The game, NutraNinja, was created to increase kid's exercise levels. When we inherited the game, there were two levels that didn't have
                                    the player moving much. We added in 3 levels with different challenges to increase the player's movement and tracked their center of mass to see if the levels were improving activity. More details,

                                    During the fall semester of my senior year of high school, I created a research project on "How does the camera affect video games?". I created a game in the Unreal Development Kit with two levels, where the player had to run and jump from one platform to another, avoiding and shooting enemies, until they reached the end of the level. There were two versions of the game: version 1 had a third person camera following behind the player, and version 2 had a fixed camera that imitated a side scrolling game.
                                    <br /><br />
                                </span>
                                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">
                                    The players had mixed feelings about the games. Version 2 was all around easier for most people, which made it more enjoyable for more casual players. Version 1 was more difficult, and the players that enjoyed version 1 more than version 2 tended to be people who had a history of first and third person shooters.

                                    For my game AI class, I created different movement behaviors using Java and Processing. Movements include basic kinematic motion, arrive steering motion where the character moves to where the mouse 
                                    clicks, wander steering, and flocking behavior.

                                skill and creativity than a LinkedIn profile. I decided to design and code the site myself to get more experience with HTML and CSS. It's been fun, and I'm always
                                trying to improve it.

                                Our team's entry to DiamondHacks 2015. If you've ever been to a bagel shop, you know that there are many bagel and cream cheese combinations to choose from. Our app makes that choice much easier by generating a combination for you. It also allows you to add a combination to your likes or dislikes, rate it, or get a new one. This was my first time working with any kind of mobile app development. I did majority of the UI/UX design, and some of the backend code.
