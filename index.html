                                Hiya! I'm Dana. I do all the things. I'm a fifth year undergrad student at NC State University, majoring in computer science with a concentration in game developement. I love 
                                coffee, video games, all things Disney, and a lot of other things that wouldn't fit if I listed them all. Currently I'm a programming intern for 
                                Bethesda Game Studios.<br /><br />

                                I'm the Media Director for Women in Computer Science at NC State, a junior officer in the Video Game Development Club, a workshop leader in STARS SLC, a CSC 
                                Ambassador, and the lead media and marketing organizer for DiamondHacks. During the semester I work for the CSC Department at NC State as a Java 2 (CSC216) Peer Teaching 
                                Fellow under Dr. Sarah Heckman. A PTF is basically a teaching assistant and lab instructor merged together. <br /><br />

                                I've worked at IBM as a support engineer intern and Juniper Networks as a systems engineer intern. I make games in my free time and I'm constantly 
                                changing my hair color. My current color is rainbow (seriously, there's like 8 colors in my hair). If you want to know more about me, click on an icon above to contact me!

                                Spilt Milky Way was made in CSC482 as part of a class game jam during the last week of classes. Much of this game was rushed (like many game jam games are) 
                                and was handed off from teammate to teammate until the last day of class. The game is a 2D space themed game where you control two spaceships, one with the 
                                left analog stick and one with the right. The goal is to line your ships up to fire at incoming projectiles. It's harder than it sounds to keep them lined up 
                                without dying!

                                the player moving much. We added in 3 levels with different challenges to increase the player's movement and tracked their center of mass to see if the levels were improving activity. More details,

                                During the fall semester of my senior year of high school, I created a research project on "How does the camera affect video games?". I created a game in the Unreal Development Kit with two levels, where the player had to run and jump from one platform to another, avoiding and shooting enemies, until they reached the end of the level. There were two versions of the game: version 1 had a third person camera following behind the player, and version 2 had a fixed camera that imitated a side scrolling game.
                                <br />

                                The players had mixed feelings about the games. Version 2 was all around easier for most people, which made it more enjoyable for more casual players. Version 1 was more difficult, and the players that enjoyed version 1 more than version 2 tended to be people who had a history of first and third person shooters.

                                Entry for Spectra, an all-female hackathon hosted at YouTube's headquarters in San Bruno, CA. An Android app to help battle NC's awful HB2 law. The hackathon was a one day event
                                and I was the only person on my team, so the app is incomplete but mockups for the design will be added to the repo soon!

                                An Android app that was a buddy to the NutraNinja game. The app had a set workout for each day of the week and let you set a reminder to go do the workout of the day. The biggest
                                issue I ran into with this project was getting the alarm to bypass the lock screen on the user's phone.

                                Our team's entry to DiamondHacks 2015. If you've ever been to a bagel shop, you know that there are many bagel and cream cheese combinations to choose from. Our app makes that choice much easier by generating a combination for you. It also allows you to add a combination to your likes or dislikes, rate it, or get a new one. This was my first time working with any kind of mobile app development. I did majority of the UI/UX design, and some of the backend code.
