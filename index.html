                                Hiya! I'm Dana. I do all the things. I'm a fourth year student at NC State University, majoring in computer science with a concentration in game developement. I love 
                                coffee, video games, all things Disney, and a lot of other things that wouldn't fit if I listed them all. <br /><br />

                                I'm the Web & Media Director for Women in Computer Science at NC State, a junior officer in the Video Game Development Club, a workshop leader in STARS SLC, a CSC 
                                Ambassador, and the lead media and marketing organizer for DiamondHacks. Right now I'm working for the CSC Department at NC State as a Java 2 (CSC216) Peer Teaching 
                                Fellow under Dr. Sarah Heckman. A PTF is basically a teaching assistant and lab instructor merged together. <br /><br />

                                I've worked at IBM as a support engineer intern and Juniper Networks as a systems engineer intern, and this coming summer I'll be an 
                                application developer intern at Allstate in summer of 2017. If you want to know more about me, click on an icon above to contact me!

                                the player moving much. We added in 3 levels with different challenges to increase the player's movement and tracked their center of mass to see if the levels were improving activity. More details,

                                During the fall semester of my senior year of high school, I created a research project on "How does the camera affect video games?". I created a game in the Unreal Development Kit with two levels, where the player had to run and jump from one platform to another, avoiding and shooting enemies, until they reached the end of the level. There were two versions of the game: version 1 had a third person camera following behind the player, and version 2 had a fixed camera that imitated a side scrolling game.
                                <br />
                            </span>
                            <span style="margin-left: 5%;">
                                The players had mixed feelings about the games. Version 2 was all around easier for most people, which made it more enjoyable for more casual players. Version 1 was more difficult, and the players that enjoyed version 1 more than version 2 tended to be people who had a history of first and third person shooters.

                                Entry for Spectra, an all-female hackathon hosted at YouTube's headquarters in San Bruno, CA. An Android app to help battle NC's awful HB2 law. The hackathon was a one day event
                                and I was the only person on my team, so the app is complete but mockups for the design will be added to the repo soon!

                                An Android app that was a buddy to the NutraNinja game. The app had a set workout for each day of the week and let you set a reminder to go do the workout of the day. The biggest
                                issue I ran into with this project was getting the alarm to bypass the lock screen on the user's phone.

                                Our team's entry to DiamondHacks 2015. If you've ever been to a bagel shop, you know that there are many bagel and cream cheese combinations to choose from. Our app makes that choice much easier by generating a combination for you. It also allows you to add a combination to your likes or dislikes, rate it, or get a new one. This was my first time working with any kind of mobile app development. I did majority of the UI/UX design, and some of the backend code.
